Colmar Academy
This project was developed as part of Codecademy's Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages Path. It served as the capstone project for learning how to build websites, where we applied all our acquired knowledge to create a fully responsive landing page from scratch.

The objective was to design a professional landing page for Colmar Academy, a new school. While provided with wireframes, videos, and image resources, the remaining design and development decisions were up to us. The project emphasized the use of responsive design techniques, including media queries, to ensure seamless viewing across desktop and mobile devices.
